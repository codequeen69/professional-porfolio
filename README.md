# Professional Portfolio

## Purpose
For this project I wanted to create a professional portfolio for potential employers by way of a single page React application. Upon load, the employer will be taken to my 'About' page where they will see a personal photo and a blurb about me. In the navigation bar there are links to a contact me section, a portfolio of my work, and my resume which can be downloaded. When an employer clicks on one of the projects in my protfolio, a modal pops up with a link to the project's Github page and a link for the deployed application. At the bottom of the page on the footer, there are three icons that link to my Github, LinkedIn, and Spotify accounts.
